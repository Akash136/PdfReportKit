Pdf Report Kit
--------------

Pdf Report Kit is a small library that helps you in the process of creating reports starting with some HTML code. With a simple syntax you can generate pdf in seconds!

### Work In Progress! :construction_worker:
I am working on a complete redesign of this library. Features will include:

* New name! (hopefully)
* Semantic versioning
* Installation via CocoaPods
* API redesign
* Internals redesign
* Unit tests

You can download the latest "stable" version on *v1.0.0* tag. Please checkout this page often for further updates.
